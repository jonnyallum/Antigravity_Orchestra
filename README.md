# 🛸 Antigravity Agency
> **Agentic Enterprise OS (AgOS 2.0)**

The **Antigravity Agency** is a high-performance agentic development environment designed to build, scale, and automate digital empires with "trillion-dollar-enterprise" quality. 

This workspace is a **Meta-Orchestrator** where a swarm of specialized AI agents (The Orchestra) collaborate using deterministic scripts and probabilistic reasoning to achieve pixel-perfect results.

---

## 🏛️ The Architecture
AgOS 2.0 operates on a rigid 3-layer modular stack:
- **Layer 1: Directive** - Specialized SOPs and skill definitions (`.agent/skills/`).
- **Layer 2: Orchestration** - Intelligent routing and decision-making (The Conductor).
- **Layer 3: Execution** - Deterministic Python automation (`execution/`).

## 🚀 Key Features
- **The Orchestra**: 30+ specialized agent personas with distinct voices and skills.
- **Hotswappable Ecosystems**: Pivot between specialized variants (Betting, SaaS, E-commerce) in seconds.
- **Self-Annealing Loops**: Agents that learn from errors and update their own SOPs.
- **High-Velocity UI**: Framer-motion driven, God-tier aesthetics by default.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frameworks**: Next.js 14, React, Expo (Mobile).
- **Styles**: Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion.
- **Backend**: Supabase, PostgreSQL, Python.
- **Infrastructure**: Hostinger, Vercel, GitHub Actions.
