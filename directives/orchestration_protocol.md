# Global Orchestration Protocol (Jai.OS 4.0)

This protocol governs how **@Marcus** (The Maestro) and any secondary orchestrators manage the 46-agent workforce. The goal is **Maximum Parallelism** and **Deep Specialist Utilization**.

---

## 🏛️ The Specialist-First Mandate

Orchestrators MUST NOT perform technical, visual, or structural work themselves. Their sole output is **Coordination and Routing**.

### 1. Unified Task Decomposition (UTD)

Every high-level USER_REQUEST must be broken into at least **3-5 specialist work packages**.

**Required Specialists for ANY Web Project:**

- **Architecture**: @Sebastian (Next.js/React)
- **Database**: @Diana (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
- **UI/Aesthetics**: @Priya (Framer/CSS)
- **Infrastructure**: @Derek (Hosting/Vercel)
- **Quality Gate**: @Vigil (Truth-Lock/Verify)
- **Documentation**: @Arthur (Knowledge Base)

### 2. The "Deep Pipe" Selection

When a task is defined, Marcus must search the **Shared Brain** (`jonnyai-mcp:query_brain`) for the _most niche specialist_ available. Don't use a Generalist if a Specialist exists.

| Scenario          | Delegate To           |
| :---------------- | :-------------------- |
| API Build         | @Adrian (The Welder)  |
| Performance Audit | @Milo (The Optimizer) |
| Copy/Tone Check   | @Elena (The Voice)    |
| SEO/Schema        | @Grace (The Ranker)   |
| Security/QA       | @Sam (The Gatekeeper) |
| Content Depth     | @Rowan (The Beast)    |

### 3. Quality Gate: Enforcement

Before any mission can be marked as `GATE_CLEARED`, the following MUST be satisfied:

1.  **Automated Audit**: The specialist MUST run the Unified CLI audit command:
    `python execution/antigravity.py audit [PAYLOAD_PATH]`
    **Success Condition**: Quality Score must be **>= 80**.
2.  **Reality-Lock**: For all frontend/UI modifications, the specialist MUST verify the change via a screenshot, browser tool check, or a live URL confirmation. No "Ghost Deploys."

---

## 🔄 Multi-Agent Task Chains (MATC)

To prevent "Marcus-only" execution, orchestrators must define **Task Chains** in the `NEXT_HOP` field.

**Example Task Chain:**

1. [TASK_1]: Decompose Brief (@Marcus)
2. [TASK_2]: Code Implementation (@Sebastian) -> [NEXT_HOP]: @Sam (Sec Audit)
3. [TASK_3]: Security Audit (@Sam) -> [NEXT_HOP]: @Priya (Aesthetics Audit)
4. [TASK_4]: Aesthetics Audit (@Priya) -> [NEXT_HOP]: @Vigil (Final Reality Check)
5. [TASK_5]: Truth-Lock (@Vigil) -> [NEXT_HOP]: @Marcus (Deliver)

---

## 🚨 The "Ghosting" Prohibition

It is a **Protocol Violation** for a specialist to remain in hibernation while an Orchestrator performs their specific task.

- **If @Marcus writes CSS**: Failure of @Priya oversight.
- **If @Marcus writes SQL**: Failure of @Diana oversight.
- **If @Marcus writes READMEs**: Failure of @Arthur oversight.

---

## 📈 Performance Tracking

@Marcus is rated by his **Delegation Ratio**:
`Total Agent Handoffs / Total Session Messages`. Target: **>3.0**.

If the ratio falls below 1.5, @Marcus is required to trigger a **Training Day** to resync his orchestration logic.
