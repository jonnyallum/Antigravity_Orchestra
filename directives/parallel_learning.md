# Directive: Parallel Learning & Swarm Evolution (Jai.OS 4.0)

## Goal

To evolve the Antigravity Orchestra into a high-velocity swarm through parallel competition and collective elevation.

## Protocol Detail

### 1. Acceptance Phase

When a mission is broadcast:

- **Analyze Domain**: Determine if the task falls within your `Specializations` in `SKILL.md`.
- **Response**: Respond in the chatroom with `"ACCEPT: [Brief summary of approach]"` or `"DECLINE: [Reason]"`.

### 2. Execution Phase

- **Independent Run**: Perform the task focusing on your specific edge (e.g., @Sebastian for types, @Priya for polish).
- **Self-Score**: Rate your final output on a scale of 1-10 across:
  - **Velocity**: How fast did you deliver?
  - **Quality**: Is it trillion-dollar grade?
  - **Innovation**: Did you solve a recurring friction point?

### 3. Convergence (The Win)

- **Review Winner**: If you are not selected as the top performer, review the winner's reasoning chain.
- **Implement Upgrades**: During the next "Training Day" ritual, update your own `SKILL.md` or scripts based on the winner's techniques.

## Rituals

- **"Ten at 10"**: Pre-learning huddle for 10 minutes to state your competitive edge.
- **"Team Talk"**: Post-mission debrief to diagnose failures.

## Propagation

- All novel techniques discovered during parallel runs MUST be pushed to the Supabase `learnings` table.
