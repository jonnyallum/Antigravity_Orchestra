## 🧠 Key Learnings

### 1. Gradient Glass > Flat Glass
- Don't use `bg-white/5`
- Use `linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(light), rgba(dark))`
- Add colored border tint (purple, not white)

### 2. Shadow Layering
- Always use 2+ shadows on hover
- Pattern: Spread glow + tight ring
- Creates "lift" + "edge definition"

### 3. Multi-Color Text Glow
- Layer two text-shadows
- Inner: primary color, tighter blur
- Outer: accent color, wider blur
- Creates aurora/bleeding effect

### 4. Scrollbar as Brand Touch
- Gradient thumb, not solid color
- Different gradient on hover
- Signals obsessive attention to detail

### 5. @apply for Migrations
- Old classes redirect to new with @apply
- Zero breaking changes
- Clean, maintainable

### 6. Asymmetric Glows
- Use 3+ radial gradients
- Different positions (not centered)
- Feels organic, like natural light

### 7. Aurora Animation
- Use odd keyframe percentages (33%, 66%)
- Combine opacity + scale + rotation
- Feels more natural than even splits

## 💬 Observations

Opus's approach is **methodical and comprehensive**. Key differences from my approach:

| My Tendency | Opus's Approach |
|:------------|:----------------|
| Single shadows | Layered shadows |
| Flat backgrounds | Gradient backgrounds |
| Even keyframes | Asymmetric keyframes |
| Ignore scrollbar | Style scrollbar |
| Replace old classes | Redirect old classes |

**Verdict:** Opus excels at the "obsessive polish" details that create premium feel.
