## 🏛️ Decision ID: `DEC-2026-02-01-001`
**Title**: Jai.OS 4.0 Mass Upgrade & Personal Development Plans
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Conductor (Marcus Cole)
**Consulted**: @JonnyAI, @Sentinel, @EcosystemCreator

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Agents were non-compliant with Jai.OS 4.0 standards, lacking modular SOPs and iterative learning loops. We also needed a way to ensure agents "keep optimizing" autonomously.

## ⚖️ Rationale for Choice
Modified the `conductor_toolkit.py` to batch-inject SOPs and Personal Development Plans (PDPs). This ensures every agent has a set schedule for skill refinement and framework testing.

## 🚀 Anticipated Impact
- 100% Agent compliance with Jai.OS 4.0.
- Autonomous evolution of agent skills via the PDP loop.

**Title**: Informal Collaboration Hub (The Chatroom)
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Conductor (Marcus Cole)
**Consulted**: @JonnyAI, @Archivist

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Structured meetings in `PROTOCOL.md` are excellent for milestones but too slow for real-time banter and cross-agent brainstorming.

## ⚖️ Rationale for Choice
Launched `chatroom.md` in `.agent/boardroom/` to allow high-velocity collaboration. Archivist will harvest insights from the chat into this log.

**Title**: Hotswappable Ecosystem Context
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Ecosystem Creator (Genesis Nova)
**Consulted**: @JonnyAI, @Conductor

## 🚩 Problem Statement
The user needs to switch between specialized contexts (Betting, SaaS, E-commerce) while maintaining the Master Jai.OS 4.0 core.

## ⚖️ Rationale for Choice
Implemented `execution/hotswap_ecosystem.py`. This allows the root `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` to be hot-reloaded with variant configurations from the `Clients/` directory.
