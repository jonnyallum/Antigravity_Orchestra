# 🤖 PROJECT BRIEF: AI-CLASH | THE DUALIST
**Status:** DRAFT | PROPOSAL
**Owner:** Jonny (The Boss)
**Orchestration:** @Marcus

## 📋 Executive Summary
A high-velocity content ecosystem for TikTok, YouTube, and X featuring two specialized AI personas ("The Dualists") who debate trending world affairs from extreme, unobjective perspectives.

## 🎯 The Vision
- **Format**: Short-form video (Daily) + Potential Long-form Podcast.
- **Characters**: Two distinct AI personas with complete backstories and visual consistency.
- **Dynamics**: One is always "FOR" (Proponent), one is always "AGAINST" (Opponent).
- **Goal**: Dissect trending social media topics from every angle and trigger user engagement ("What do you think?").

## 🛠️ The Pipeline
1. **Trend Spotting** (@Sophie): Hourly/Daily scans of X, TikTok, and Reddit for viral topics.
2. **Deep Dissection** (@Rowan): Comprehensive analysis of the topic, identifying key arguments for both sides.
3. **Scripting** (@Echo): Meticulous planning of the "unobjective" debate to maximize retention.
4. **Visual Synthesis** (@Priya): Cost-effective video generation using human/cartoon characters.
5. **Monetization** (@Forge): Funnel design and market testing for sponsorships/affiliates.

## 💰 Resource Constraint: "Red Eye" Protocol
- **Objective**: Minimal cost, maximum quality.
- **Visuals**: Explore free/cheap generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion local, Hedra, LivePortrait).
- **Voice**: High-quality free TTS or low-cost cloned voices.
