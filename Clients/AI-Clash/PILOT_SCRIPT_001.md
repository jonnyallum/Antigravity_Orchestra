**Topic:** Nintendo Direct & Switch 2 Leaks
**Duration:** 60 Seconds (Vertical Short)

**[0:00 - LEO (Extreme Close-up)]**
**LEO:** Stop scrolling! The Switch 2 isn't just a console; it’s a portal to the next decade of gaming! The latest leaks? 12GB RAM, DLSS 3.5, and backward compatibility. This is the death of the home PC!

**[0:15 - VICTOR (Split screen or cut to)]**
**VICTOR:** Leo, breathe. It’s a tablet with a fan. 12GB of RAM in 2026? My fridge has more processing power. Nintendo is just selling you the same Mario Kart port for the fourth time. It's a gimmick to hike the price to $499.

**[0:30 - LEO (Animated, hands moving)]**
**LEO:** A gimmick? Victor, they’re bringing *Fallout 4* and *Indiana Jones* to your pocket! Native 4K docked! It’s the "trillion-dollar" handheld. If you aren't pre-ordering, you're living in 2017!

**[0:45 - VICTOR (Leaning back, skeptical)]**
**VICTOR:** I'm living in reality. $499 for hardware that's three years behind Steam Deck 2 is a robbery. They'll lock your old digital library behind a "Switch 2 Premium" sub. Watch. It’s not progress; it’s extraction.

**[0:55 - LEO & VICTOR (Together)]**
**LEO:** It’s a revolution!
**VICTOR:** It’s a scam.
**LEO:** Who's right? Let us know in the comments—are you pre-ordering or passing?
