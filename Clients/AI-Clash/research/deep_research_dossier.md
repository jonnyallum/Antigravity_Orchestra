# 🧠 THE DUALIST: DEEP RESEARCH DOSSIER
**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Topic:** Automated AI Debate Channel Pipeline
**Confidentiality:** AgOS 3.0 Standard

## 1. MARKET ANALYSIS: THE TREND-DEBATE ARBITRAGE
The "Dualist" format exploits the **Engagement-Controversy Loop**. By having two AI personas take extreme, unobjective sides, you trigger the platform algorithms (TikTok/YouTube) which prioritize comments and watch-time. 
- **The "Brainrot" Trend (2026)**: Users are pivoting toward hyper-fast, polarized content.
- **Engagement Trigger**: "Who is right?" at the end of every video forces users to choose a side in the comments, doubling the reach.

## 2. THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURES
### A. "The Red Eye" (Low-Cost/Local)
- **Visuals**: Character generation via **FLUX.1 [dev]** (Local Forge). Use consistent seeds to maintain persona identity.
- **Motion**: **LivePortrait** mapped to a human face (Driver Video). This is $0 in cloud cost if run on your desktop.
- **Voice**: **ElevenLabs** (Free tier per account) or **Piper/Bark** (Local).
- **Editing**: **CapCut Pro** (Human-in-the-loop or assisted by `pyCapCut` automation).

### B. "The Enterprise" (Scalable/Cloud)
- **Video**: **Synthesia** or **Google Veo**. $15-$30/month for professional dialogue-driven avatars.
- **Automation**: Use **JSON2Video API** to bypass manual editing entirely.

## 3. CAPCUT PRO AUTOMATION
Your CapCut Pro subscription is a massive asset. While an official API doesn't exist, we can use the **`pyCapCut`** library to:
1.  Automatically load character clips and background music.
2.  Apply saved "Dualist" style templates.
3.  Generate automatic captions.
4.  **The Machine's Job**: @Autoflow can use these scripts to prepare "Draft" files for you, so you only have to click "Export."

## 4. AGENT UPGRADES: @Scout (Sophie)
To make this work, @Scout / Sophie needs a specialized **Trend Scraper Skill**:
- **P0**: Search Reddit (r/popular), X (Explore), and TikTok Creative Center hourly.
- **P1**: Identify not just the "Topic," but the **Opposing Arguments** already happening in the comments.
- **P2**: Extract "Heated" comments to use as script dialogue for Victor or Leo.

## 5. NEXT STEPS FOR TOMORROW
1.  **[ ] Character Finish**: Finalize Leo and Victor's specific visual prompts.
2.  **[ ] Automation Script**: Test a basic `pyCapCut` script to generate a draft.
3.  **[ ] Trend Lock**: Sophie scans for the first topic of the day.
4.  **[ ] Voice Cloning**: Test "Arrogant Tech-Bro" and "Cynical Professor" voice clones.
