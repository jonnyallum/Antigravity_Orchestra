# Plan: Antigravity Workflow Optimization v1.0

## Objective

Optimize the Jai.OS 4.0 orchestration workflow by leveraging the new **Antigravity Brain MCP Server** to ensure 100% data parity between local SKILL.md files and the Supabase Shared Brain.

## Success Criteria

1.  **Sync Parity**: The `agents` table in Supabase must contain the latest markdown content from all local `SKILL.md` files.
2.  **Tool Readiness**: The `query_brain` and `sync_agent_philosophy` tools must be verified as functional.
3.  **Automated Logging**: Every sync action must be documented in the `chatroom` via the `post_broadcast` tool.
4.  **Local Integrity**: No `SKILL.md` files should be corrupted during the sync process.

## Steps

1.  **Orchestra Audit**: Run `python execution/validate_agents.py` to ensure all 45 agents are structurally sound.
2.  **Shared Brain Sync**: Use `python execution/sync_all_skills_full.py` (which should be updated to use the MCP) to push data to Supabase.
3.  **Verification**: Execute a `query_brain` call to verify that a specific agent's philosophy is retrievable.
4.  **Final Broadcast**: Signal the completion of the optimization loop to the chatroom.
