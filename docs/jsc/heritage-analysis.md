## 1. Layout Patterns & Structure

- **Grid System**: 12-column grid, often split into 3-column modules (1/3 width blocks) for services and project highlights.
- **Centering**: Fixed max-width (~1140px) on desktop to maintain focus and control text line lengths.
- **Spacing (Vertical)**: Aggressive use of vertical padding (80px-100px) between sections. This is a hallmark of premium design—avoiding the "cramped" feel of budget construction sites.
- **Whitespace**: Generous horizontal margins and "breathable" image containers.

## 2. Typography Hierarchy

- **Serif (The "Heritage" Anchor)**: `Crimson Text`
  - _Usage_: High-level headings, intros, storytelling blocks.
  - _Vibe_: Trustworthy, traditional, architectural.
- **Sans-Serif (The "Modern" Contrast)**: `Montserrat`
  - _Usage_: Navigation, sub-labels, small UI elements.
  - _Vibe_: Clean, precise, technical.
- **Scale**:
  - **H1**: ~36px-42px, bold, often all-caps or wide tracking.
  - **Body**: 16px, high line-height (1.6) for sustained reading.

## 3. Imagery Treatment

- **Composition**: Symmetrical layout of project photos.
- **Framing**: Blend of wide structural shots and macro "craftsmanship" close-ups (e.g., joinery, masonry).
- **Ratios**: Strict 16:9 or 3:2.
- **Application for JSC**: We will use B&W as the default "Foundation State" and reveal the full color on hover/scroll to showcase the quality of the finish.

## 4. Navigation & Flow

- **Minimalism**: No "mega-menus." A flat structure: _Home, About, Projects, Services, Contact._
- **Sticky UX**: Dark-themed sticky header ensures a constant "Call to Action" presence.

## 5. Color Palette (Extracted)

- **Primary**: `#000000` (Black)
- **Secondary**: `#FFFFFF` (White)
- **UI Tone**: `#212121` (Off-black)
- **CTA Accent**: JSC Brand Color (To be confirmed from assets).

## 6. Target Aesthetic: "The Luxury Contractor"

We are moving away from "builder" tropes (yellow/orange caution themes) and moving toward "architectural studio" aesthetics.
