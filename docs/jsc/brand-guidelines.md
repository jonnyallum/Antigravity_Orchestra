# Brand Guidelines & Content Strategy: JSC Contractors

**Agents**: @Elena (Copywriter) & @Vivienne (Brand Identity)
**Project**: Jai.OS 4.0 God-Tier Rebuild

## 1. Brand Positioning

- **The Core Identity**: JSC is not just a building firm; they are _custodians of craftsmanship_. They bridge the gap between "Heritage West Sussex" aesthetics and modern structural integrity.
- **The Values**: Precision, Detail-Obsessed, Timeless Design, West Sussex Heritage.
- **The Voice**: Confident, refined, understated. We don't shout about "Cheap Quotes"; we speak about "Legacy Builds."

## 2. Visual Identity (B&W Reveal)

- **The Philosophy**: Black and White represents the _Foundation_—the raw skill and structure. Color represents the _Mastery_—the finished, high-quality result.
- **Primary Palette**: Solid Black (`#000`), Pure White (`#FFF`), Rich Charcoal (`#1A1A1A`).
- **Signature Font**: `Crimson Text` (Serif) for Authority; `Montserrat` (Sans) for Precision.

## 3. Key Messaging (Hero Drafts)

- **Option 1**: "Building with purpose. Crafted with care."
- **Option 2**: "The raw beauty of construction. Revealed in color."
- **Option 3**: "Heritage standards. Modern execution."

## 4. Content Structure

- **Homepage**: Full-width Hero (Scroll Reveal), Masonry Project Grid (Hover Reveal), Service Chapters (Chapter spacing as per Heritage Analysis).
- **Portfolio**: Grouped by project type (Residential, Restoration, Extensions). All B&W by default.
