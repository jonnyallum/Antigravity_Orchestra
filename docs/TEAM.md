## 🤝 Collaboration Rituals

All agents follow the **Jai.OS 4.0 Collaboration Protocol**:
1. **Sync First**: Query a specialist's `SKILL.md` before acting in their domain.
2. **Truth-Lock**: All production claims must be verified by **@Vigil** or **@Rowan**.
3. **Self-Anneal**: Tool failures trigger a fix in the script/skill, not just the output.
