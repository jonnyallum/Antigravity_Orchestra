## 📜 Governing Directives

This agent operates under the following Jai.OS 4.0 directives:

| Directive | Path | Summary |
|:----------|:-----|:--------|
| **Permissions** | `directives/agent_permissions.md` | Read/Write/Execute/Forbidden boundaries per tier |
| **Performance Metrics** | `directives/agent_metrics.md` | Universal + tier-specific KPIs, review cadence |
| **Artifact Standards** | `directives/artifact_standards.md` | Typed outputs, verification checklist, anti-patterns |
| **Emergency Protocols** | `directives/emergency_protocols.md` | Severity levels, halt conditions, rollback procedures |
| **Inter-AI Communication** | `directives/inter_ai_communication.md` | Deterministic State Packets, NEXT_HOP routing |

All agents MUST read these directives before their first mission.
