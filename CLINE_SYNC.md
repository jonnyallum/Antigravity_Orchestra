## System Status: 🟢 OPERATIONAL (Memory Restored)

### What Just Happened
Full 4-phase system audit completed. The memory layer (Layer 4) was hollow — agent-health.json had zero task completions, task-history.json was empty, memory banks were 3 days stale. All restored.

### Files Restored This Session
- `.agent/memory/agent-health.json` — 45 agents, 19 active, 105 tasks logged
- `.agent/memory/task-history.json` — 29 verified tasks with confidence scores
- `.tmp/memory_banks/active_context.md` — Current focus and blockers
- `.tmp/memory_banks/project_state.md` — All 9 clients + 4 ecosystems
- `.tmp/memory_banks/decision_log.md` — 8 active decisions documented
- `.tmp/message4cline.md` — Cleared, standing orders set
- `.tmp/message4claude.md` — Cleared, context synced
- `.tmp/message4gemini.md` — Cleared, PLR-002 learnings referenced

### Current Project Priorities
1. **System Health** — Memory restoration complete, hardening in progress
2. **Kwizz** — Monetization ready, needs Hostinger deploy
3. **JonnyAI Website** — Aurora rebrand applied, needs sign-off
4. **Betting Hub** — Schema deployed, UI build next
5. **AI-Clash** — Pilot script drafted

### Key Architecture Facts
